# movies_data_analysis
  I was very interested in data visualisation tools and happened to find a dataset of movie plot data from Wikipedia, 
 which I used to build a basic interactive tool which takes in a word as input and provides the frequency of that element 
 in movie plots throughout the years. 
 
  The idea was that a threshold frequency of the word like “murder” would reflect 
 the usage of murder as a plot element in the script and further gives insight into the evolution of plot elements 
 throughout years.
